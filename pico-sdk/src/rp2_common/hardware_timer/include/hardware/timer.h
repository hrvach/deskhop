 *
 * Low-level hardware timer API
 *
 * This API provides medium level access to the timer HW.
 * See also \ref pico_time which provides higher levels functionality using the hardware timer.
 *
 * The timer peripheral on RP2040 supports the following features:
 *  - single 64-bit counter, incrementing once per microsecond
 *  - Latching two-stage read of counter, for race-free read over 32 bit bus
 *  - Four alarms: match on the lower 32 bits of counter, IRQ on match.
 *
 * By default the timer uses a one microsecond reference that is generated in the Watchdog (see Section 4.8.2) which is derived
 * from the clk_ref.
 *
 * The timer has 4 alarms, and can output a separate interrupt for each alarm. The alarms match on the lower 32 bits of the 64
 * bit counter which means they can be fired a maximum of 2^32 microseconds into the future. This is equivalent to:
 *  - 2^32 รท 10^6: ~4295 seconds
 *  - 4295 รท 60: ~72 minutes
 *
 * The timer is expected to be used for short sleeps, if you want a longer alarm see the \ref hardware_rtc functions.
